## Issue Summary

No LLM models successfully generated narratives for evaluation.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Invalid API Keys** - Check that your API keys are correct and active
2. **API Rate Limits** - You may have exceeded free tier limits
3. **Network Issues** - Check your internet connection
4. **Model Availability** - Some models might be temporarily unavailable

### Models Attempted:
- gemini: ❌ FAILED
  - Error: API key invalid or missing; generation skipped.


### Next Steps:

2. Check API usage limits at provider dashboards
3. Ensure you have active internet connection
4. Try running with a single model first (e.g., just Gemini)
