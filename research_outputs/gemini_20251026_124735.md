## Revenue Performance Analysis

While we achieved a total revenue of $7,701,204.28 for the fiscal year, the revenue trend is concerning. Monthly sales have been consistently declining, from a peak of $2,100,327.10 in January 2024 to a low of $87,815.89 in November 2024, representing an average monthly decline of -13.72%. This downward trend, with a trend strength of $160,574.77, necessitates immediate action.

**Product/Category Performance:**

*   **Electronics** led in total sales with $3,703,812.70, followed by **Furniture** at $2,303,005.93.
*   **Software** contributed $1,411,105.83, while **Office Supplies** lagged behind at $283,279.82.
*   The top 5 products – Smartphone X, Smartwatch, Laptop Pro, Tablet Plus, and Headphones – collectively generated a significant portion of revenue, indicating a concentration of sales in a few key products.

**Geographic/Regional Performance:**

*   **Latin America** was the top-performing region with $1,620,668.15 in sales.
*   **Europe** closely followed with $1,570,902.28.

The relatively even distribution of sales across regions suggests a diversified market presence, but also highlights the potential for growth in underperforming regions like the Middle East.
